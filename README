                FACIAL EXPRESSION RECOGNITION
========================================================================

THIS IS A SMALL PROJECT OF MACHINE LEARNING DONE DURING OUR 3rd SEMESTER
IN THIS REPOSITORY YOU CAN FIND:
    ->MODEL
    ->NOTEBOOK
    ->SMALL APP TO TEST ANY IMAGE OF FACIAL EXPRESSION

IN OUR PROJECT WE USED A SMALL CNN MODEL THAT WE FINE-TUNED.
AT THE END, AN ACCURACY OF 57% WAS ACHIEVED.
IT IS NOT THAT GREAT, AND OF COURSE IT CAN BE IMPROVED.

STEPS TO RUN THE APP:
    -> CREATE A VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT AND ACTIVATE IT
    -> IN A TERMINAL, RUN       pip install -r requirements.txt
    -> RUN           python3 app.py  OR    flask run
    -> TEST THE IMAGES
